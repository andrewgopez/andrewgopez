## About me
Hi, I'm Andrew, a former Computer Science student now studying Linguistics and Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) in Montreal. I started coding during the COVID-19 pandemic and quickly developed a passion for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've always been fascinated by technology and enjoyed working on websites and applications. Although Iâ€™m now focused on linguistics and SLP, I continue to pursue computer programming and web design as hobbies.

### Goals
I aim to blend my computer science background with my studies in linguistics and SLP to develop innovative tools and solutions that enhance communication and language therapy. I aim to leverage my technical skills to advance research and practice in these fields, creating impactful and accessible solutions for those in need.
