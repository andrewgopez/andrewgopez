## About me
I am a computer science student based in Montreal, Canada. I started coding during the COVID-19 pandemic and developed a passion for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a computer science student, I've been interested in websites, computer architecture, and console app development since I was young. Seeing people impressed with my computer science major is what I love about being in computer science. My goal is to contribute innovative solutions and collaborate with like-minded individuals, pushing the boundaries of technology.
